Exercise 2: Mini Blog Post About Your Hobby
Create a blog post webpage about something you're passionate about.
Requirements:

Create an HTML structure similar to the Code Magazine you have
Include:

A header with a site name and navigation links (even if they don't go anywhere yet)
A main article with title, author info, and at least 4-5 paragraphs
A sidebar with "Related Articles" (fake titles and authors are fine)
A footer


Use both ID and class selectors
Include at least one image (can be a placeholder)

CSS Styling Requirements:

Create a header with background color
Style the sidebar differently from the main content
Use descendant selectors for at least one element
Make the related articles list look clean
Add borders to at least one section
Use different font sizes and colors throughout
