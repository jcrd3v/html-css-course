Exercise 1: Personal Recipe Card
Build a simple recipe card webpage for your favorite dish.
Requirements:

Create an HTML file with a recipe (choose any dish you like)
Include these elements:

A main title (recipe name)
A subtitle (like "Prep time: 15 minutes")
An ingredients list (unordered list)
A numbered steps list (ordered list)
At least 2-3 paragraphs describing the dish or cooking tips
A footer with your name as the "chef"



CSS Styling Requirements:

Style the main title to be uppercase and a different color
Make the subtitle italic
Style the lists (maybe remove bullets from ingredients, style the steps)
Use different font sizes for different elements
Add a background color to either the whole page or a specific section
Make your name in the footer stand out somehow
